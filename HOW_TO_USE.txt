Launchpad - Local quickstart
============================

This is a static site (HTML, CSS, JS). No build step.

Open it
-------
- Double-click index.html.

Or serve it locally (optional)
------------------------------
- Python 3: python -m http.server 8080, then visit http://localhost:8080
- Node: npx --yes serve -l 8080, then visit http://localhost:8080

Data
----
- Profile and points live in localStorage.
- To reset, clear site data in your browser, or click "Clear" on the Profile page (profile only).

Pages
-----
- Home: Landing page with quick links.
- Profile: Save your name, role, bio, and skills. Shows your points.
- Launchpad: Projects you create and track.
- Skill Link: Filter projects and people by skills.

Points
------
- "Mark Completed" adds +10 points.
- "Mark Failed" deducts -6 points.

Notes
-----
- Uses a single external script (three.js) for the particle background; everything else is plain HTML/CSS/JS.
- If you prefer fewer animations, enable the "Reduced Motion" setting in your OS/browser and the site will dial them back automatically.
